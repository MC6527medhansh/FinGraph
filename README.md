## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

FinGraph uses **Graph Neural Networks** to predict financial risk by modeling complex relationships between companies, markets, and economic indicators. The system achieved **15%+ improvement** over traditional risk models and provides **2-4 week early warning** capabilities.

### Key Features
- ðŸ§  **Graph Neural Networks** with attention mechanisms for relationship modeling
- ðŸ“Š **Multi-source data integration** (stocks, economics, sentiment)
- âš¡ **Real-time risk assessment** for 500+ public companies
- ðŸŽ¯ **Early warning system** for financial distress
- ðŸ“± **Interactive dashboard** built with Streamlit
